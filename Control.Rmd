 The most common control structures are:
1. *** `if` *** statements: These allow you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met.

2. *** `for` *** loops: These allow you to repeat a block of code a fixed number of times.

3. *** `while` *** loops: These allow you to repeat a block of code an unknown number of times, until a certain condition is met.

4. *** `repeat` *** loops: These are similar to while loops, but they always execute at least once, regardless of the condition being met or not.

5. *** `ifelse` *** statements: These are a shorthand for a simple if-else condition.

`if (condition) {
  # statements to be executed if condition is true
} else {
  # statements to be executed if condition is false
}`

```{r}
x <- 2
if (x > 0) {
  print("x is positive")
} else {
  print("x is non-positive")
}

```
```{r}
x <- 5
result <- ifelse(x > 0, "positive", "non-positive")
print(result)

```

A loop in R is a way to repeatedly execute a set of statements
`for (variable in sequence) { # statements to be executed }`

```{r}
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}

```

`while (condition) { # statements to be executed }`
```{r}
counter <- 1
while (counter < 6) {
  print(counter)
  counter <- counter + 1
}
```


```{r}
i <- 1
while (i <= 5) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
}

```
```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = 6:10)
apply(df, 1, function(row) {
  print(row)
})
```
## nested loop
```{r}
for (i in 1:3) {
  for (j in 1:2) {
    print(paste("i:", i, "j:", j))
  }
}

```
## First 10 positive integers:
```{r}
n <- 1
sum <- 0

repeat {
  print(n)
  n <- n + 1
  if (n > 10) {
    break
  }
}

```

# Mean :
$$Mean , \mu = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i$$

```{r}
data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
sum <- 0

for (i in 1:length(data)) {
  sum <- sum + data[i]
}

mean <- sum / length(data)
print(mean)

```

# Median : 
$$Median = \begin{cases}
\frac{x_{\frac{n}{2}}}{2} & \text{if n is odd} \\
\frac{x_{\frac{n}{2}} + x_{\frac{n}{2} + 1}}{2} & \text{if n is even}
\end{cases}
$$

Here, $x_{\frac{n}{2}}$ and $x_{\frac{n}{2} + 1}$ represent the $\frac{n}{2}$th and $\frac{n}{2} + 1$th ordered values of the set of observations $x$, respectively, and $n$ is the number of observations in the set. If $n$ is odd, the median is equal to the middle value of the ordered set. If $n$ is even, the median is equal to the average of the two middle values.
where $x_i$ represents the $i^{th}$ value of the data set and $n$ is the total number of values in the data set.

```{r}
data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

if (length(data) %% 2 == 1) {
  median <- data[(length(data) + 1) / 2]
} else {
  median <- (data[length(data) / 2] + data[length(data) / 2 + 1]) / 2
}

print(median)

```

# SD : 
$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2}$$
where $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are the observations and $\mu$ is the mean.

```{r}
data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mean <- 3
sum_of_squared_differences <- 0

for (i in 1:length(data)) {
  sum_of_squared_differences <- sum_of_squared_differences + (data[i] - mean)^2
}

standard_deviation <- sqrt(sum_of_squared_differences / (length(data) - 1))
print(standard_deviation)

```
## test 
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
result <- sd(x)
print(result)
```


## Find the sum of the first 10 positive integers
```{r}

n <- 10
sum <- 0
for (i in 1:n) {
  sum <- sum + i
}
print(sum)
```

```{r}
# Calculate the factorial of 5

n <- 5
result <- 1
for (i in 1:n) {
  result <- result * i
}

print(result)
```

```{r}
#Factorial of a number:  For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

n <- 5
result <- 1
for (i in 1:n) {
  result <- result * i
}
result
```
```{r}
n <- 10
fib <- numeric(n)
fib[1] <- 0
fib[2] <- 1
for (i in 3:n) {
  fib[i] <- fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]
}
fib
```
Prime numbers: Given a positive integer n, find all the prime numbers up to n.
```{r}
n <- 20
primes <- numeric(0)
for (i in 2:n) {
  is_prime <- TRUE
  for (j in 2:(i - 1)) {
    if (i %% j == 0) {
      is_prime <- FALSE
      break
    }
  }
  if (is_prime) {
    primes <- c(primes, i)
  }
}
primes

```
Use of For loop
```{r}
# create the .csv files
for (i in 1:5) {
  x <- runif(100, 0, 100)
  y <- runif(100, 0, 100)
  df <- data.frame(x, y)
  write.csv(df, paste0("fake_data_", i, ".csv"))
}

# read the .csv files and perform calculations
for (i in 1:5) {
  df <- read.csv(paste0("fake_data_", i, ".csv"))
  x_mean <- mean(df$x)
  y_mean <- mean(df$y)
  corr <- cor(df$x, df$y)
  
  # generate plots
  png(paste0("plot_", i, ".png"))
  plot(df$x, df$y)
  abline(lm(df$y ~ df$x), col = "red")
  # Use round() to control the number of decimal places in the plot title
title(paste0("x_mean = ", round(x_mean, 2), "; y_mean = ", round(y_mean, 2), "; corr = ", round(corr, 2)))
  dev.off()
}

```
There are several alternatives to for, while, and repeat loops in R, including:

1.apply functions: These functions can be used to apply a function to the rows or columns of a matrix or data frame. Examples include apply, sapply, lapply, and tapply.
```{r}
#Example of using apply to find the row sums of a matrix
mat <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2)
apply(mat, 1, sum)

#Example of using sapply to find the standard deviation of each column in a data frame
df <- data.frame(A = rnorm(10), B = rnorm(10))
sapply(df, sd)

#Example of using lapply to find the length of each element in a list
lst <- list(a = 1:5, b = 6:10)
lapply(lst, length)

#Example of using tapply to find the mean of each group defined by a factor variable
x <- rnorm(100)
group <- rep(1:5, each = 20)
tapply(x, group, mean)

```


2.map functions from the purrr package: These functions provide a more modern and flexible alternative to the apply functions, allowing you to apply a function to elements of a list, vector, or data frame and return the result in a tidy format. Examples include map, map_dbl, and map2.
```{r}
#Example of using map to find the square of each element in a vector
library(purrr)
x <- 1:5
map(x, ~ .x^2)

#Example of using map_dbl to find the square root of each element in a vector
map_dbl(x, sqrt)

#Example of using map2 to find the element-wise product of two vectors
y <- 6:10
map2(x, y, ~ .x * .y)

```


3.mapply function: This function is a multivariate version of sapply, allowing you to apply a function to the elements of multiple arrays or lists in parallel.
```{r}
#Example of using mapply to find the element-wise sum of two vectors
x <- 1:5
y <- 6:10
mapply(`+`, x, y)

```


4.rowSums, colSums, rowMeans, and colMeans functions: These functions provide a convenient way to summarize the rows or columns of a matrix or data frame without using a loop.
```{r}
#Example of using rowSums to find the row sums of a matrix
mat <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2)
rowSums(mat)

#Example of using colSums to find the column sums of a matrix
colSums(mat)

#Example of using rowMeans to find the row means of a matrix
rowMeans(mat)

#Example of using colMeans to find the column means of a matrix
colMeans(mat)

```


5.aggregate function: This function allows you to aggregate data in a data frame by one or more grouping variables and apply summary functions to the subsets of the data.
```{r}
#Example of using aggregate to find the mean of each group defined by a factor variable
x <- rnorm(100)
group <- rep(1:5, each = 20)
aggregate(x, by = list(group), mean)

```


#Conclusion
Each of these alternatives has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice of which one to use will depend on the specific requirements of your analysis.
